# Flight Search App [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

This project demonstrates the use of _MVP architecture pattern_ on an Android Application developed in **Kotlin**. It uses _Repository pattern_ as well as **Dagger** for _Dependency Injection_. 

This application connects to [Skyscanner API](https://partners.skyscanner.net/affiliates/travel-apis/) to query flight results.

It consists of 3 screens: 
* Search screen (first screen)
![Search screen](/art/init.png)
* Search locations / places screen - We search for airports here
![Search places screen](/art/search_place.png)
* Results screen with flights information.
